# Commands

## start

Starts a new timeslice. Only one timeslice is allowed to be running.

`punch start my-project`

## stop

Stops a previously started timeslice:

`punch stop`

## log

Log all timeslices grouped by day:

`punch log`

## summarize

Summarizes timeslices by project and day:

`punch summarize`

## import

Import frames generated by watson. Watson uses a simple json format to store data:

`punch import ~/.config/watson/frames`

Note: currently tags are not supported and will not be imported!

# Todo

- [ ] add filters to limit output for `log` and `summarize` commands
- [ ] add colored output
- [ ] use locale when displaying dates in grouped output
- [ ] add n2n relation timeslice <==> tag
- [ ] import tags from watson frames
- [ ] ensure db consistency s.t. only one slice can be in running state. using a trigger on insert/update?

# Done

- [x] add start command
- [x] add stop command
- [x] add command / output similar to `watson log`
- [x] use clap to define commands
- [x] add import command
